### Reflection
In the industrial visit to UTM DIGITAL, my team and I had the opportunity to learn more about how UTM DIGITAL operates and provides services for UTM students and staff. We gained insights into the day-to-day workings of a software engineering team, including how collaboration and teamwork are managed in a professional environment. This experience highlighted the differences between working in a real-world setting and the academic environment, particularly in terms of project management, communication, and problem-solving under deadlines.

To build on this experience, I plan to focus on improving my teamwork and communication skills, as these are crucial for success in a professional software engineering role. I will also seek more opportunities to work on collaborative projects, both within and outside of academia, to better understand how to manage tasks and responsibilities in a team setting. Additionally, I aim to enhance my technical skills, particularly in areas like project management tools and software development practices, to bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world application. Finally, I will actively seek feedback from peers and mentors to continuously refine my approach to teamwork and problem-solving.
