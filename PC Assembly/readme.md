# PC Assembly
## Reflection
In this PC Assembly workshop, I had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in assembling a PC, from installing the RAM to setting up the hard disk. This workshop allowed me to understand the function of each component and the importance of proper handling to avoid damage.
Additionally, this workshop improved my skills in:
- Technical Knowledge: I now have a clearer understanding of how different hardware components work together, such as the motherboard, CPU, GPU, and storage devices.
- Precision and Attention to Detail: Handling delicate components like the CPU and RAM taught me the importance of careful and precise installation to prevent damage.
- Time Management: Assembling a PC within a set timeframe improved my ability to work efficiently while maintaining accuracy.

Overall, this workshop was a great learning experience that enhanced my technical skills and gave me practical knowledge that I can apply in future projects or career opportunities in the tech field.
