### Reflection
In my first semester of the Bachelor of Computer Network and Security with Honours course, I have learned a great deal, particularly through the design thinking project. My team and I came up with the idea to develop a traffic management system application to address the traffic issues we face in UTM. Working on this project has significantly improved my problem-solving, creativity, and teamwork skills, which are essential for my future career.

For improvement, I believe gaining more hands-on experience in coding real-life projects would better prepare me for future work. Practical coding in a professional environment differs greatly from academic studies, and more exposure to such scenarios would be beneficial. Additionally, the industrial visits have been eye-opening, showing me how companies in Malaysia are leveraging advanced technologies to create impactful projects. These experiences have broadened my perspective and motivated me to aim higher in my career.

Overall, this semester has been a valuable learning journey, and I look forward to further developing my skills through certifications, competitions, and more practical projects in the future.
